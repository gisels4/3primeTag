3'mRNA-seq is a different approach to transcript analysis, sequencing only a short fragment at the 3' fragment extracted via polyA capturing technologies.
The main advantage is the reduced amount of sequence and therefore price and a clearer corelation between number of reads and number of transcript since each read represent one transcript.

An interesting pubpication to consult is "A comparison between whole transcript and 3â€™ RNA sequencing methods using Kapa and Lexogen library preparation methods' by Ma et al 2019 (https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-5393-3)
